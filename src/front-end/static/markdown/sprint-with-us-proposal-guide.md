## Team Questions

The Proponent should provide responses to the Team-based questions contained in this Team Questions Tab. The Team-based questions are specific to the Opportunity and are intended to demonstrate the Team's: 

1. experience working as a team; 
2.  experience with Agile software development; and 
3. experience working on a similar Product, with a similar scope and technical background.

The Proponent’s responses should not reference organization name, Resource name, or specific company software. No points will be awarded for any Proponent answer to any question in this step that references the Proponent’s organization name, Resource name, or specific company software.

## Pricing

In the Pricing tab, Proponents are asked to propose a Total Phase Cost for the following indicated Phases. If a maximum budget amount is identified in this tab for any Phase(s), the Total Phase Cost must not exceed the maximum amount for that Phase. The automated system will add the Total Phase Costs and calculate the Total Proponent Cost displayed on this tab. The Total Proponent Cost must also be within the total maximum budget amount specified on this tab.

The Proponent is free to nominate a Team with as many of its Resources as it believes appropriate for the Opportunity, provided that the Proponent stays within the maximum budget amounts specified in this tab.

The RFP system will not permit a Proponent to submit a Proposal unless this mandatory requirement is satisfied.

## Team Selection

For each of the Phases (Inception, Proof of Concept and Implementation) on this tab, the Proponent must select its Team by clicking on each of its proposed Resources (a minimum of two for each Phase), and satisfy the required Capabilities set out for the applicable Phase and Phase Window. A green check mark will appear next to all required Capabilities that your Team’s Resources have been deemed to satisfy, based on current Resource Profiles.

The RFP system will not permit a Proponent to submit a Proposal unless this mandatory Capabilities requirement is satisfied.
