Before you begin developing your opportunity it in important that you are aware of the following requirements and restrictions:

- Sprint With Us is for opportunities up to, but not exceeding, $2,000,000.
- Sprint With Us is intended for government to procure a contractor technical team.
- Sprint With Us is intended for projects with unknown requirements and deliverables. This approach is designed for government and contractor teams to work together to discover and implement a digital solution.
- In order to issue a Sprint With Us opportunity, you must have Procurement Services Branch review and approve your procurement prior to posting. You can contact them by emailing [digitalmarketplace@gov.bc.ca](mailto:digitalmarketplace@gov.bc.ca).

The Sprint With Us (SWU) opportunity page will require several details from you to ensure a clear and fulsome procurement with the vendor community. The following outlines the required sections and the level and kinds of detail required.

## The Overview Tab

Title – As you may expect, is the title of your project and is limited to 200 characters.

Teaser – This is a short summary of what your project is about and is limited to 500 characters. The purpose of this is to, at a glance, grab the attention of the vendor community and pique their interest.

Remote OK? – Does the vendor need to work on premises, or can they work remotely? It is important that you clearly identify what your expectations are of the vendor early on as many CWU applicants operate across the province and beyond.

Remote Description – (If Yes was selected for Remote Ok?) – This identifies any caveats that may apply to a Remote work contract. Here are three options as examples:

- Meet once in person every two weeks
- Must be available in Prince George if requested
- No in-person required

Proposal Deadline – This is the deadline for when you will accept proposals. The submission requirement is scheduled for 4pm Pacific Time on the date you select.

Assignment Date – This is the date that you will be assigning the project to the Successful vendor.

Total Maximum Budget – This identifies the Total Project Budget. A project maximum of $2,000,000 is a requirement of the SWU process. This is not limited by fiscal year and is intended to identify the entire scope of the project.

Minimum Team Members – This identifies to the vendor community the minimum staffing level acceptable in their proposal. For product development teams of this nature, we commonly see teams of 5-9 contractors, and as a result, the minimum range if between 1 and 5.

Required Skills – Here you can identify one or more skills that you require vendors to possess to complete the project. If you do not see the skill that you are looking for, you may create a new skill by entering it into the field directly.

## The Description Tab

Description – In this section you will provide details around the following:

- Who you are? Ministry, Division, Branch. Provide the vendor with an understanding of who they will be working for.
- The Background of the project. What work, if any, has been done in this space in the past? Is this a net new project, or is this a continuation of previous efforts?
- What work are you expecting the vendor to complete? This will explain, in detail, the level of effort and the extent of work required from the vendor in order to complete the project. This will fully explain all aspects of the project and all deliverables that must be completed in order for the vendor to fulfill their responsibilities for the contract.

## The Phases Tab

Here you will indicate the what phase your project is currently in to identify to the vendors what type of work they may be expected to deliver upon. The option phases, in sequence, are:

- **"Inception Phase"**: the first phase of Product development, during which the Product Team will collaborate on the development of the initial Product Backlog.

- **"Proof of Concept Phase"**: the second phase of Product development, during which the Product Team will collaborate on the further development of the Product Roadmap, a working alpha release of the Increments, and a Resourcing Plan for the Implementation Phase.

- **"Implementation Phase"**: the third phase of Product development, during which the Product Team will collaborate on the delivery of the functional components on the Product Roadmap.

Upon selection of your intended Phase, additional details will become available:

Phase Start Date - This is the intended start date for the Successful vendor to being work on the selected phase.

Phase Completion Date - This is the date that the Successful vendor is to submit the finished phase product requirements.

Maximum Phase Budget – This is the limit that the government is willing to spend on this specific phase. The culmination of all phases does not necessarily equal your maximum budget, but rather is simply indicating how much government is willing to spend in that particular phase before the potential need to re-evaluate the project scope.

Team Capabilities – In this section, you will select the Capabilities, as identified in the list, that are required from the contractor team. Once you select a Capability, a toggle will appear requiring you to select whether that role is expected in a Full or Part-time capacity.

## The Team Questions Tab

Once you have selected “Add Question”, additional dialogue boxes will appear.

Question – Here you will enter a question that you intend for the vendors to respond to. It is recommended that the questions align with your project and are clear in their intent on how the vendors should respond.

Response Guidelines – This is where additional details may be included to further clarify the approach the vendors should take when responding to your question. It is important to note that it is expected that you will provide a response guideline for every question you include.

Word Limit – This creates a work cap for the responses provided from the vendors. We recommend a word cap of 300-500 words per question.

Score – This identifies the weighting of this particular question in relation to the other questions and the total Team Questions scoring calculation.

## The Scoring Tab

In this section you will be required to identify the overall scoring distribution that will oversee the entire evaluation process. We have provided the typical defaults that we have utilized in the past. Any changes to this rubric will require approval from Procurement Services Branch.

## The Attachments Tab

On this tab there is a “Add Attachments” button where you can include and documents (PDF, DOC, etc.) for the vendors to provide further detail regarding the project. Additional documents often include, Technical Architecture diagrams, Repository documentation or additional alternative project materials.
